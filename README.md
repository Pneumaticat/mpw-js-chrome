# Master Password for Chrome

Code from [Master Password's web app](https://github.com/Lyndir/MasterPassword/tree/master/Site/mpw-js) packaged into a Google Chrome extension. Edits made to CSS to clean it up and make it more suitable for a Chrome extension. Additionally, added a feature to pre-fill the Site Name box with the current domain when visiting a page.
